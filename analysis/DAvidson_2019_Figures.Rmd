# Comments from Richard

<--The legend on this figure also needs work. For example, the symbols for Yes and No are the same in the legend, so how do you tell which is which? And there are two legends named Stoat control, one which distinguishes valleys, but another legend termed Valley that also seems to distinguish valleys.-->

<--So itâ€™s not possible to tell what is going on.-->

cap.pred <- c("**Figure 1:** *Each arrow and label represents a prediction we tested (Prediction B to D). Each prediction represents a collection of previous studies that have suggested how mouse populations may respond to seed availability in the presence or absence of stoats. A) during the years when no seed is available (non-mast years; Panel A); B) at the peak of mouse abundance (winter or spring); C) the season when mice populations are responding rapidly to increasing seed abundance (summer to winter in mast years; Panel B); D) when mouse abundance declines (spring to summer; Panel B).  The top panel represents the average seed availability cycle in New Zealand Native Beech Forests between non-mast (no shading) and mast years (shaded grey). The bottom panel represents the expected response of mouse abundance ($N_{j,t}$) to the variation in seed availability ($Seed_{j,t}) above where solid yellow symbols represent locations where stoats are un-controlled*")

The dashed lines and large points represents the time during which each experimental manipulation was carried out. The background dots represent each individual replicate (independent populations). Points are jittered slightly (0.2) so replicates can be observed. Squares represent replicates *without?* rat removal and diamonds represent replications with rat removal undertaken.*")
